# ![*](res/app48.png) stahky
A take on [stacky](https://github.com/pawelt/stacky) in AutoHotkey (AHK) for Windows 10

## Usage
- Drag a folder with shortcuts, programs and files onto stahky
  - A taskbar pinnable icon will be created.
  - You should edit the shortcut's icon before pinning it.
  - Once pinned, you can delete the shortcut file.
- Appearance settings -> Edit stahky.ini
- You can have stahky shortcuts within your folder for custom submenus. Stahky-licious!
  - Stahkys that have circular references will be capped by the recursion depth setting `STAHKY_MAX_DEPTH` (default is 5).
- Press <kbd>WheelButton</kbd> / <kbd>MButton</kbd> on a Stahky to open its folder for easy editing.
